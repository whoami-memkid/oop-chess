# OOP-chess-framework

Framework for building a chess game

To use this chess framework, you have to set up the Objects and create only one tracker.

Link the tracker with all the objects using the setTracker(Tracker &refTracker) function.

You need to initialize all the pieces to the board values from (0, 0) to (7, 7).

You need to implement the move function for all the classes.

I haven't done anything to the move functions, so you'll have to implement how the pieces move.

I'm taking a break from this project...
